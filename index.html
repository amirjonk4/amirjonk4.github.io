    The 2024 Maserati MC20

    Power for the MC20 Coupé and Cielo come from a twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 rated for 621 horsepower and 538 pound-feet of torque. Dubbed “Nettuno,” the engine represents a new, purpose-built design engineered in Modena by Maserati, sidestepping the previous practice of using engines adapted from corporate siblings. Featuring a unique twin-combustion system borrowed from Formula 1 race cars, the 90-degree V-6 engine is paired exclusively with an eight-speed automatic transmission. Maserati claims 207.6 horsepower per liter, a metric that puts it in league with other high-end supercar makers like Lamborghini, Ferrari, McLaren, and Porsche. In C/D testing, the MC20 hit 60 mph in 3.2 seconds and knocked off the quarter-mile in 11.0 seconds, clearing the traps at 131 mph. In addition to blisteringly quick acceleration, the MC20's handling is race-car sharp. Despite this, the MC20 won't punish you with an overtly harsh ride, flinty handling, or unforgiving throttle response; with the adaptive suspension set in its most comfortable mode, the chassis is forgiving enough to consider driving it daily or taking it on a road trip. Maserati also says an all-electric variant of the MC20 with all-wheel drive will hit the market in short order but hasn't released any technical details regarding the battery or electric motors yet. That said, we expect to hear more about the EV model sooner than later.
